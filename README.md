The Collaborative Study Organizer is a web-based platform designed to help students manage their study schedules, organize resources, and collaborate effectively with peers. The platform integrates productivity-enhancing tools, such as a Pomodoro Timer, task management, and a shared resource library, into a centralized hub. Our goal is to provide students with a comprehensive system that fosters effective learning, time management, and teamwork.
